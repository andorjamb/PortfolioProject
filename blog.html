          <h2 id="blog-from-scratch">Chapter 1: Making a blog from scratch</h2>
          There is basic advice on this site:
          <a href="https://code.makery.ch/library/html-css/part5/">code.makery</a>
          <p>
            I think that if you are not using JavaScript, you can't actually
            load pages into a div...instead your blog will just be a single-page
            application, and you have to make internal links to the post
            headings (by using jump links).

        <article>
          <h2 id="css-specificity">CSS Specificity</h2>
          <p>For any page element there are almost always conflicting styles affecting how it should be displayed 
            in the browser.  The specificity rules exist to clarify to the browser which one should be dominant
            in each case.</p>
            <p>Firstly, the very concept of cascading means that unless you specify otherwise, an element
              will automatically inherit the CSS styling of its parent. (This is
              called 'inheritance'.) </p>
              <p>Also that, given styles that would otherwise be equal in specificity, more recent styles will take precedence. 
                'Most recent' means 'closest to the bottom of the sheet', or 
                'closest to where the element itself appears in the html'.</p>
          <p>The situation can quickly become very complicated with the addition of classes, ids, and inline styles.
            An algorithm involving four style selector categories is used to work out which style should apply.
          </p>
          <h3>A few general notes on the hierarchy:</h3>
          <p>Inline &ltstyle&gt tags will override stylesheet styles for an element. 
            !important after a property value can be used to over-ride any specificity rule 
            or inline style. Eg <span style="color:green">color: green !important;</span>
            But in general it should be avoided.</p>
        
          <h4>Selector specificity</h4>
          <p>Basically anything that identifies an element is a selector, 
            eg:
            <ul><li>Types like Div, id, class, a</li>
            <li>pseudo-classes like :hover</li>
          <li>pseudo-classes like :first-child, first-of-type</li></ul>
          </p>
        
        <h3>How it works:</h3>
          <p>Selector specificity = 0, 0, 0, 0</p>
         <p>Consider it is a number without the commas: eg 0000 < 0100  < 1010
          The higher the value of this number is, the more specific it is.
          </p>

<h4>Child versus Descendant</h4>
<p></p>
<h4>Aside Note on CSS Efficiency</h4>
            <p>Note: For the sake of decreasing the browser's workload, it's better to use shorter selectors
              wherever possible. This means reducing the amount of child and descendant selectors.
            </p>

          
                        
         <!--Specificity values: a three digit string, eg (2-4-1)
          where the first digit: means the number of ID selectors
          second digit: number of class selectors
          third digit: numbre and type selectors and pseudo-elements. 
                        
           The browser compares thes values to determine which style wins.
                        
           Eg .red.blue.yellow //  0-3-0
                        
        div.yellow#red // 1-1-1-->

          <p>Including javascript in your html file: you should encourage the webpage to load the javascript LAST by
            linking to the script near the end of the document, most commonly just before the &lt/body&rt tag. Otherwise it 
            might have awkward results as loading of the javascript file slows down the rest of the page.

          <h2 id="git">Git Commands</h2>

          <h3>Configuring your remote repository</h3>

          <div class="codetype">git remote</div>
          <p>This command will show you the names of your remote repos. 
            ('Origin' will appear as the name of the default server that you cloned your local repo from.)</p>

         <h3></h3>cloning a remote repo to your local host</h3> 


          <p>To push to a specific branch:</p>
          <div class="codetype">git push origin name-of-branch</div>
          <h3>Making your current branch the default branch:</h3>
          <blockquote>
            "You can set a global option for “git push” to push the code to the
            current branch by executing the following command:
            <div class="codetype">git config --global push.default current</div>
            Now you can just type…
            <div class="codetype">git push</div>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Source:
            https://hayato-iriumi.net/2020/10/13/git-push-to-the-current-branch/
          </p>
          <h3>Merging changes you've made on a branch into the master</h3>
          <p>
            First you need to change back to the master, by checking it out:
          </p>
          <div class="codetype">git checkout master</div>
          <p>
            Now you have a local copy of the master. You are going to add the
            changes to the local master first, with the command:
          </p>
          <div class="codetype">
            git pull origin master<br />git merge branch-name
          </div>
          <p>
            then you push the updated and merged master back to the remote repo:
          </p>
          <div class="codetype">git push origin master</div>

<h3>Changing or updating a remote repository location</h3>
<p>If you change the name of your repository on GitHub, git will still redirect your commits 
  to the new location, but you should update it anyway, in case someone else starts using the 
  old repository name (then the redirect will no longer happen)</p>
  <p>For addresses using an SSH key:</p>
          <div class="codetype">git remote set-url origin git@github.com:[username/repo-name.git]</div>
          <p>For HTTPS:// addresses:</p>
          <div class="codetype">git remote set-url origin https://github.com/[username/repo-name.git]</div>

          <p>Putting the following tag in the doc's head over-rides the mobile browser's trick of 
            "pretending" to have a bigger screen than it actually does, and prevents it squashing all the 
            content to fit:
          </p>
          <div class="codetype">
          &ltmeta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"&gt
          </div>


          <p>
            Note: "Friction" in web design terms basically just means unnecessary
            clutter or steps to complete an action on a website, or slow-loading
            elements that make the experience frustrating.

          <h2 id="page-layout">Page Layout with HTML and CSS</h2>

  <p></p><blockquote><i>"An important concept to understand first is that every single element on a web page 
    is a block. Literally a rectangle of pixels."</i></blockquote> <br>
            <a >(CSS Tricks)</a>

           <p>A bit of layout history: page layouts were initially constructed using the html &lttable&gt tags
            to distribute content in rows and colomns. Then CSS enabled the positioning and float properties.  
            More recently, Flex Box and Flex properties allow docs to flow and scale much more flexibly. 
            Grid layout is the most recent development (and not yet fully supported). </p>

            <h3>Using the Position property:</h3>
            <p><span class = "emphatic">"Static"</span>is the default value, and means for an element to sit wherever it would usually sit in the HTML.</p>
         <p><span class="emphatic">"Absolute" positioning</span>  instead fixes an element outside the normal HTML flow. It is usually combined 
           with properties that specify its exact position on the page, namely:<br>
           Top <br>
           Right<br>
           Bottom<br>
           Left<br>
(You only specify one property for vertical and one for horizontal, if needed at all).
The abolute-positioned element will be placed relative to the &ltbody&gt element, or to the "closest"
non-statically-positioned element. 
<p>It is designated in pixels relative to either the nearest absolute-postioned parent element, of the HTML 
  page itself (the root block, or "initial containing element"), if no such element is found. 
</p>
<p><span class="emphatic">Relative positioning</span> is actually basically the same as absolute positioning, except 
that it takes as its reference where it <i>would</i> have been positioned if in normal flow.</p>
<p>Relative position of an element means relative to its static position, and defining the position this way allows 
  you to move the element, eg, 10px left or right from where it would otherwise sit. </p>
